# Advanced Sales Forecasting & Customer Analytics

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics pipeline combining SQL Server, Python, and Power BI to move beyond historical reporting into customer analytics and forecasting readiness.

The solution mirrors real-world analytics engineering workflows:
SQL Server → Python Analytics → SQL Analytics Layer → Power BI Dashboards.

## Business Objectives
- Identify high-value and at-risk customers
- Analyze monthly sales trends for forecasting readiness
- Understand customer behavior using RFM segmentation
- Deliver executive-ready analytics dashboards

## Tech Stack
- SQL Server (Data Warehouse & Analytics Layer)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, pyodbc)
- Power BI (Data Modeling & Visualization)
- VS Code, SSMS

## Architecture
SQL Server (DW)
→ Python (EDA, RFM Segmentation)
→ SQL Server (Analytics Tables)
→ Power BI (Insights & Dashboards)

## Key Analytics
- Monthly sales aggregation (forecast-ready time series)
- RFM-based customer segmentation
- Customer distribution and revenue contribution analysis

## Power BI Dashboards
1. Sales Performance & Forecast Readiness
2. Customer Segmentation (RFM) & Revenue Contribution

## Key Outcomes
